# RestWithASP.NET5-Udemy

main repo for the course lessons

## This repo won't be mantained in the correct way (by creating branches and merging them into the master), but a lot of folders will be created in order to record all the steps taken in the course. So, there will be probably a lot of projects inside this single repository.
