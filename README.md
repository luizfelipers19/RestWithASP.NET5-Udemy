# RestWithASP.NET5-Udemy

main repo to store my progress while doing @leandrocgsi 's course. This course can be found at https://www.udemy.com/course/restful-apis-do-0-a-nuvem-com-aspnet-core-e-docker/
### Current State:

- Add Docker support and containerize the project. I'm having issues w/ Docker Compose, and I decided to learn more about the tool to come back here later.
- Integrate with Github Actions to perform CI/CD
- Deploy to the cloud

#### P.S.: This repo won't be mantained in the correct way (by creating branches and merging them into the master), but a series of folders will be created in order to record all the steps taken in the course. So, don't panic, because there will be (probably) a lot of projects steps inside this single repository.

#### P.S.2: The API still wasn't deployed, mainly because I've done other courses about WebAPI's using .NET Core, and my Azure user free-tier account is already over.
